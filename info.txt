WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO : Create a Navbar that looks like the one on vitonaelastomers.in. It should also be responive. Also you need to add an image(bg.png) behind the Navbar(HINT : Make th Navbar absolutely positioned). 



NOTE : You don't need to add the carousel. One image is only required. 

NOTE2 : Also don't bother with the underline effect on the links.

NOTE3 : For the brand please use the logo.png image


OPTIONAL : Use Media Queries to add a colour to the Navbar on small screen sizes
